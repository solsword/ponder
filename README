# Datalens

Version: pre-alpha

A Javascript + HTML tool for visualizing data interactively.

Reads a JSON list of data items, like so:

[
  { "coords": [ 1.827, 4.483 ], "prop": "val", "otherprop": "otherval" },
  ...
]

Uses the 'coords' properties of each item to display them in a graph, and
allows viewing the rest of the properties based on a circular selection cursor
with various grouping modalities.
