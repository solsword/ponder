# Ponder

Version: pre-alpha

A Javascript + HTML tool for visualizing data interactively.

Similar to the R package RadViz.

Use [pre.html](pre.html) to process data for input into the [index.html](index.html) main visualizer.

A JSON array of records, each of which is an array of values is the basic input
format, with the first record containing strings for field names. CSV import
will happen at some point. Data might look like:

[
  [ "coords", "prop", "otherprop" ],
  [ [ 1.827, 4.483 ], "val", "otherval" ],
  ...
]


Displays each item in a graph, and allows viewing the other properties based on
a circular selection cursor.

Grouping modalities for secondary display are a work in progress.
